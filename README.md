# project_chatbot
Digitization is transforming our society, and chatbots are essential in this mobility-driven transformation. Industries like banking, e-commerce, retails, and many more use chatbots to stay connected with customers. Chatbots are a great way to be present and solve your customersâ€™ queries without an actual human. This way, now, businesses can stay in touch with their customers even after their business working hours. It is one of the main reasons chatbot development service are so high in demand.

After working at a new-age company where I am currently employed, I discovered that the company spends a significant amount on salaries for teams that handle customer queries. This insight motivated me to develop a chatbot that could automatically respond to reduce marketing costs.
For the front-end, we chose to use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any additional frameworks. We chose not to use other frameworks because we wanted to devote our time to enhancing our understanding of JavaScript.
For the backend we chose php language and MySQL .
